# Steve's Stock Analysis Project

## Overview.
### The purpose of this analysis was to refactor our previous code so we can make the speed of the outcome faster.  By downloading **challenge_starter_code.vbs** file and changing the name to **VBA_Challenge.vbs**, I was able to modify lines of code.  

## Explanation.
### A total of eight lines of code where refactored.  Comments were added to explain the process and two PNG files created.  By removing extra loops in the original code, the speed of the new code was about five times faster.  Unnecessary passing of code added time to the process.

## Summary.
### By removing loop lines of codes, the speed of the process was much faster. As you can see from the screenshots below, both 2017 and 2018 speed times increased dramatically.


Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
