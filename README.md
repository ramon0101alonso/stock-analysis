# Steve's Stock Analysis Project

## Overview.
### The purpose of this analysis was to refactor our previous code so we can make the speed of the outcome faster.  By downloading **challenge_starter_code.vbs** file and changing the name to **VBA_Challenge.vbs**, I was able to modify lines of code.  

## Explanation.
### A total of eight lines of code where refactored.  Comments were added to explain the process and two PNG files created.  By removing extra loops in the original code, the speed of the new code was about five times faster.  Unnecessary passing of code added time to the process.

## Summary.
### By removing loop lines of codes, the speed of the process was much faster. As you can see from the screenshots below, both 2017 and 2018 speed times increased dramatically.  Advantage of Steve's Stock Analysis is efficiancy.  Disadvange of the original code is unnecessary loops through data.
